                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Presently I am working as a contractor for ICF doing React development at the US Federal Government
                    Health and Human Services department. Having worked most of my career with small teams, practically
                    and literally solo in many cases - it has been hugely exciting getting to work closely with so many
                    different and talented developers. 
                </p>
                <p>This career has been enjoyable particularly because there is a seemingly limitless number of 
                    different things to learn. It's really fun getting into a project and knowing that I'll come 
                    out on the other side with some interesting new skill or technique. I am fortunate to have 
                    worked with so many smart people. There's so much to pick up and I treasure the experience. 
                    It is exceedingly gratifying when I have the opportunity to share what I have learned with 
                    my colleagues.
                </p>
                
{/*<p>I love music. My kids got me into bluegrass when they were young.&nbsp; I found that I had gravitated to wanting to learn the banjo and was obsessed with getting one for a few years. I finally did and with the help of a ton of YouTube watching, taking notes, and hours of practice I managed to learn some songs and am continuing to make steady progress. Learning to play banjo has given me endless joy.</p>
<p>One of my ultimate favorite songs - "Can't Get There From Here" by R.E.M. has a verse that says, "If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go". Philomath is a town in Georgia I've never yet been to but I appreciate the notion of finding my way through the world and learning as many new things as I can.</p> */}
