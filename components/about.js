                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm currently working as a full stack web developer with the Marketing group at Taconic Biosciences. I have had many interesting challenges translating design into performant front end code. My job provided me with some great opportunities to expand into back end programming - creating APIs and data solutions to increase utility of department assets and information resources.</p>
                <p>This career has been really enjoyable because there is a bottomless well of many different things to learn. It's really cool setting down to a project and having the expectation that I'll come out on the other side with some new subskill or technique. It has also been great working with so many really smart people. There's always so much to absorbe but I'm happy to be along for the ride.</p>
                <p>I love music and my kids got me into bluegrass when they were really young. Although when I was a teenager anything Country Music related was the furthest from what I would have called enjoyable. As an adult I was able to let go of prejudices and open my mind up to different sounds. Specifically Old Time and Bluegrass - probably nobody else would make this connection but they feel like the Punk Rock version of Country. What with the fast tempo and kind of sketchy themes. Murder ballads?! So as a consequence to all that I gravitated to the banjo and was obsessed with getting one for a few years. I finally did and with the help of a ton of YouTube watching, taking notes, writing my own tab, downloading tab, and playing along I managed to put together some beginner ability playing 3 finger style and clawhammer. Learning to play banjo has given me endless joy.</p>
                <p>One of my ultimate favorite songs - "Can't Get There From Here" by R.E.M. has a verse that says, "When the world is a monster, Philomath is where I go". Philomath is a town in Georgia I've never yet been to but I cotton to the idea of finding my way through the world by learning as many new things as I possibly can.</p>
