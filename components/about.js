                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm currently employed as a full stack web developer with the Digital Marketing group at Taconic Biosciences. In the last several years I have had many interesting challenges translating requirements and design into performant front end code. My work has provided me with many great opportunities to expand into back-end programming, including creating APIs and data solutions to increase utility of department assets and information resources.</p>
<p>My career has been particularly enjoyable because there is a seemingly limitless number of different things to learn. It's exciting getting into a project and knowing that I'll come out on the other side with interesting new skills or techniques. I am also fortunate to have worked with a number of smart people who have encouraged and supported my growth as a developer. I have treasured the experience and find it exceedingly gratifying when I get the opportunity to share what I have learned with my colleagues.</p>
<p>I love music. My kids introduced me bluegrass when they were little and that led to an obsession with learning to play the banjo. I bought one a few years ago and with the help of a ton of YouTube watching, taking notes, and hours of practice I managed to learn some songs and am continuing to make steady progress. Learning to play banjo has brought me endless joy.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs - "Can't Get There From Here" by R.E.M. has a verse that says, "If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go". Philomath is a town in Georgia I have yet to visit but I appreciate the notion of finding my way through the world and learning as many new things as I can.</p>
